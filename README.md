LAB 4: TopLeft- Cube using texture A and normal map with built in texture functionality. 
TopMiddle- Cube using just texture A with built in texture functionality, from given code.
TopRight- Cub using texture B and normal map with built in texture functionality.
BottomLeft - Cube with texture C loaded with shaders, given code.
Bottom Right - Cube with texture D tiled with shaders. I added a check to see if the coordinate values were over the middle and subtracted by that amount. I then doubled the uv coordinates to make it a 2x2 tiled texture.
24-A: x = 7U, 24-B: y = 7-7V, 24-C: Light grey

 TOP CUBE- my shader that sets the cube to a rainbow. Removed the mix and uniforms and not setting a specific color.
  LEFT CUBE-my material with a wireframe, colored pink and is pink emissive as well
  CENTER CUBE- The given cube material, grey with green specular
  RIGHT CUBE- given shader, interpolates between blue/green
